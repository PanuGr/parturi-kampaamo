## State Management & Model Handoff Protocol
Because different models execute different phases of this build, you MUST maintain a state-tracking file named `docs/brief.md` in the docs folder (`/docs/`). 
- **If `docs/brief.md` exists:** Read it completely before doing anything else. It is your ultimate source of truth for project state.
- **Before ending any session/phase:** You must update or generate a fresh `docs/brief.md` using the strict template below. Do not consider a phase complete until this file is written.

```md
# Project Brief & State Transfer: [Client Name]
## 1. Current Status
| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Last Completed Phase** | [e.g., Phase 2.5 — Prototyping] |
| **Current Project Mode** | [Strategy / Design / Build] |
| **Last Active Model** | [e.g., Claude Sonnet Latest] |

## 2. Immutable Decisions Made
*(List definitive choices that the incoming model must NOT change or re-ask)*
- **Target Audience:** [Details]
- **Primary Goal:** [Details]
- **Core Visual Style:** [Details]

---

## 3. Current File Registry & Manifest
*(Tracks what has actually been written to disk so far)*
- [ ] `design.md` — [Status: Rewritten to Bootstrap / Still Tailwind / Missing]
- [ ] `src/styles/_variables.scss` — [Status: Tokens Mapped / Missing]
- [ ] `src/components/Navbar.astro` — [Status: Extracted from Stitch / Missing]

## Phase 1 - Astro components
Treat `index.html` as read-only. Never modify it — it is the reference, not the working file. Use it to:
1. Identify components & props: find repeating structures and values (navbar, hero, cards, sections, footer) and make them `.astro` components with props.
2. Replace hardcoded content with prop values or slots
3. The goal is componentization, not rewriting. If a Bootstrap class in the HTML works correctly in v5, keep it.
4. Map the build order: start from the outermost layout components inward (Layout → Navbar → sections → sub-components)

### 1.1 Astro Patterns
- Semantic HTML5 first
- Prefer Astro components (`.astro`) for layout and static content
- Use component islands only where client-side interactivity is genuinely needed
- Pass data via props; avoid hardcoding content inside components
- Use Astro's built-in image optimization (`<Image />`) for all images
- Use Astro's built-in font optimization (Astro Font Provider API `astro.config.mjs`) for fonts
- Layouts live in `src/layouts/`, reusable components in `src/components/`

## Phase 2 - SCSS during build

The design-guidelines in `docs/design.md` and the initial SCSS partials already exist. If new SCSS is needed while building (a rule not yet covered), check `docs/design.md` first, then the existing SCSS partials, before writing anything new. Don't re-derive translation rules here.

## Phase 3 - Javascript
- No class constructors — use named functions
- DOM manipulation via `document.querySelector` and event listeners
- Keep scripts scoped to their component using Astro's `<script>` tag
- Minimal TypeScript: use it for prop types in `.astro` frontmatter only

## Phase Handoff Requirement (MANDATORY)
Compile state progress into  `docs/brief.md` using State Management Template.
